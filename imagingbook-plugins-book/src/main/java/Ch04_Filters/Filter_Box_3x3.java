/**

 * ImageJ plugin for a linear 3Ã—3 "box" filter. 
 * First a duplicate (copy) of the original image (orig) is created,
 * which is used as the source image in the subsequent filter computation. 
 * The resulting value q is placed in the original image. Notice that the
 * border pixels remain unchanged because they are not reached by the iteration
 * over (u,v).
 * See Sec. 4.2 (Prog. 4.1) of [1] for additional details.
