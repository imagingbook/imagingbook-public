/**
 * <p>
 * ImageJ plugin implementing a simple linear 3Ã—3 "box" filter. First a duplicate (copy) of the original image (orig) is
 * created, which is used as the source image in the subsequent filter computation. The resulting value q is placed in
 * the original image. Notice that the border pixels remain unchanged because they are not reached by the iteration over
 * (u,v). See Sec. 4.2 (Prog. 4.1) of [1] for additional details. The filter kernel is implicitly defined by the inner
 * loop and has uniform weights.
