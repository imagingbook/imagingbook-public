/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements color quantization based on the octree method. It is a
 * re-factored version of an implementation ({@code OctTreeOpImage.java}) used
 * in Sun's JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) framework, which &ndash; in turn &ndash;
 * is based on a C implementation ({@code quantize.c}) by John Cristy in 1992 as
 * part of <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>. The associated
 * source code can be found <a href=
 * "https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/quantize.c">
 * here</a>, the original license note is provided at the bottom of this source
 * file. This implementation is similar but not identical to the original octree
 * quantization algorithm described in [1].
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses a modified strategy for pruning the octree for
 * better efficiency. "Quick quantization" means that original colors are mapped
 * to their color index by simply finding the containing octree node. Otherwise,
 * the closest quantized color (in terms of Euclidean distance) is searched for,
 * which is naturally slower. See Sec. 13.4 of [2] for more details.

%
%  Realism in computer graphics typically requires using 24 bits/pixel to
%  generate an image. Yet many graphic display devices do not contain
%  the amount of memory necessary to match the spatial and color
%  resolution of the human eye. The QUANTIZE program takes a 24 bit
%  image and reduces the number of colors so it can be displayed on
%  raster device with less bits per pixel. In most instances, the
%  quantized image closely resembles the original reference image.
%
%  A reduction of colors in an image is also desirable for image
%  transmission and real-time animation.
%
%  Function Quantize takes a standard RGB or monochrome images and quantizes
%  them down to some fixed number of colors.
%
%  For purposes of color allocation, an image is a set of n pixels, where
%  each pixel is a point in RGB space. RGB space is a 3-dimensional
%  vector space, and each pixel, pi, is defined by an ordered triple of
%  red, green, and blue coordinates, (ri, gi, bi).
%
%  Each primary color component (red, green, or blue) represents an
%  intensity which varies linearly from 0 to a maximum value, cmax, which
%  corresponds to full saturation of that color. Color allocation is
%  defined over a domain consisting of the cube in RGB space with
%  opposite vertices at (0,0,0) and (cmax,cmax,cmax). QUANTIZE requires
%  cmax = 255.
%
%  The algorithm maps this domain onto a tree in which each node
%  represents a cube within that domain. In the following discussion
%  these cubes are defined by the coordinate of two opposite vertices:
%  The vertex nearest the origin in RGB space and the vertex farthest
%  from the origin.
%
%  The tree's root node represents the the entire domain, (0,0,0) through
%  (cmax,cmax,cmax). Each lower level in the tree is generated by
%  subdividing one node's cube into eight smaller cubes of equal size.
%  This corresponds to bisecting the parent cube with planes passing
%  through the midpoints of each edge.
%
%  The basic algorithm operates in three phases: Classification,
%  Reduction, and Assignment. Classification builds a color
%  description tree for the image. Reduction collapses the tree until
%  the number it represents, at most, the number of colors desired in the
%  output image. Assignment defines the output image's color map and
%  sets each pixel's color by reclassification in the reduced tree.
%  Our goal is to minimize the numerical discrepancies between the original
%  colors and quantized colors (quantization error).
%
%  Classification begins by initializing a color description tree of
%  sufficient depth to represent each possible input color in a leaf.
%  However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color
%  description tree in the classification phase for realistic values of
%  cmax. If colors components in the input image are quantized to k-bit
%  precision, so that cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the
%  root node to allow representing each possible input color in a leaf.
%  This becomes prohibitive because the tree's total number of nodes is
%  1 + sum(i=1,k,8k).
%
%  A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, cmax = 255.
%  Therefore, to avoid building a fully populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1)
%  Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed;  (2)
%  Chooses a maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired
%  number of colors in the output image (currently log2(colormap size)).
%
%  For each pixel in the input image, classification scans downward from
%  the root of the color description tree. At each level of the tree it
%  identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space
%  containing the pixel's color. It updates the following data for each
%  such node:
%
%    n1: Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube
%    which this node represents;
%
%    n2: Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at
%    lower depth in the tree;  initially,  n2 = 0 for all nodes except
%    leaves of the tree.
%
%    Sr, Sg, Sb: Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for
%    all pixels not classified at a lower depth. The combination of
%    these sums and n2  will ultimately characterize the mean color of a
%    set of pixels represented by this node.
%
%    E: The distance squared in RGB space between each pixel contained
%    within a node and the nodes' center. This represents the quantization
%    error for a node.
%
%  Reduction repeatedly prunes the tree until the number of nodes with
%  n2 > 0 is less than or equal to the maximum number of colors allowed
%  in the output image. On any given iteration over the tree, it selects
%  those nodes whose E count is minimal for pruning and merges their
%  color statistics upward. It uses a pruning threshold, Ep, to govern
%  node selection as follows:
%
%    Ep = 0
%    while number of nodes with (n2 > 0) > required maximum number of colors
%      prune all nodes such that E <= Ep
%      Set Ep to minimum E in remaining nodes
%
%  This has the effect of minimizing any quantization error when merging
%  two nodes together.
%
%  When a node to be pruned has offspring, the pruning procedure invokes
%  itself recursively in order to prune the tree from the leaves upward.
%  n2,  Sr, Sg,  and  Sb in a node being pruned are always added to the
%  corresponding data in that node's parent. This retains the pruned
%  node's color characteristics for later averaging.
%
%  For each node, n2 pixels exist for which that node represents the
%  smallest volume in RGB space containing those pixel's colors. When n2
%  > 0 the node will uniquely define a color in the output image. At the
%  beginning of reduction,  n2 = 0  for all nodes except a the leaves of
%  the tree which represent colors present in the input image.
%
%  The other pixel count, n1, indicates the total number of colors
%  within the cubic volume which the node represents. This includes n1 -
%  n2  pixels whose colors should be defined by nodes at a lower level in
%  the tree.
%
%  Assignment generates the output image from the pruned tree. The
%  output image consists of two parts: (1)  A color map, which is an
%  array of color descriptions (RGB triples) for each color present in
%  the output image;  (2)  A pixel array, which represents each pixel as
%  an index into the color map array.
%
%  First, the assignment phase makes one pass over the pruned color
%  description tree to establish the image's color map. For each node
%  with n2  > 0, it divides Sr, Sg, and Sb by n2 . This produces the
%  mean color of all pixels that classify no lower than this node. Each
%  of these colors becomes an entry in the color map.
%
%  Finally,  the assignment phase reclassifies each pixel in the pruned
%  tree to identify the deepest node containing the pixel's color. The
%  pixel's value in the pixel array becomes the index of this node's mean
%  color in the color map.
