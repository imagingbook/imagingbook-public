/**
 * This (abstract) class represents a generic scalar filter whose
 * pixel-operation is x/y-separable. It is similar to
 * {@link GenericFilterScalar} but requires two methods to be implemented by
 * concrete sub-classes: {@code doPixelX(PixelSlice, int, int)} and
 * {@code doPixelY(PixelSlice, int, int)} for the x- and y-pass, respectively,
 * which are invoked in exactly this order. If the processed image has more than
 * one component (e.g., a RGB color image), this filter is automatically and
 * independently applied to all (scalar-valued) components. The remaining filter
 * mechanics including multiple components, out-of-bounds coordinate handling,
 * multiple passes and data copying are handled by this class and its
 * super-class (see {@link GenericFilter}).
