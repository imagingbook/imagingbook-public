/**
 * This (abstract) class represents a generic vector filter whose pixel-operation is x/y-separable. It is similar to
 * {@link GenericFilterVector} but requires two methods to be implemented by concrete sub-classes:
 * {@link #doPixelX(PixelPack, int, int)} and {@link #doPixelY(PixelPack, int, int)} for the x- and y-pass,
 * respectively, which are invoked in exactly this order. The remaining filter mechanics including out-of-bounds
 * coordinate handling, multiple passes and data copying are handled by this class and its super-class (see
 * {@link GenericFilter}).
