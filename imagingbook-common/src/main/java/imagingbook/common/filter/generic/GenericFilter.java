/**
 * <p>This is the (abstract) root class of the generic filter hierarchy.
 * Generic filters are designed to work with all types of
 * ImageJ images, i.e., sub-classes of {@link ImageProcessor}.
 * Filters implemented with this framework use a set of unified
 * image data structures, all based on {@code float} values
 * (see {@link PixelPack} and {@link PixelSlice}).
 * Input images are transparently copied from and back to these
 * float data, thus authors of new filters do not need to concern themselves
 * with the original pixel data types.
 * Behind the scenes, classes {@link GridIndexer2D} and {@link OutOfBoundsStrategy} are relevant for
 * pixel indexing and out-of-boundary coordinates handling.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Generic filters support multiple passes, the associated control 
 * structures are implemented by this class {@link GenericFilter}.
 * Most filters only require a single pass.
 * If more passes are required, the concrete (terminal) filter class
 * should override the method {@code passesRequired()} to return the 
 * required number, which may change dynamically during the execution 
 * of the filter (e.g., to reach convergence of some sort).
 * Sub-classes provide definitions for scalar filters, i.e., filters
 * that operate independently on the different components of color images
 * (e.g., see {@link GenericFilterScalar}),
 * as opposed to vector vector filters that deal with color datea as
 * vectors (e.g., see {@link GenericFilterVector}).
 * In addition, both types provide sub-classes for X/Y-separable versions
 * (see {@link GenericFilterScalarSeparable} and {@link GenericFilterVectorSeparable}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the simplest (though frequent) case a concrete filter class only needs 
 * to implement a single method to specify the work to be done for calculating the
 * value of a single image pixel (e.g., see 
 * {@code GenericFilterVector.doPixel(PixelPack, int, int)} and
 * {@code GenericFilterScalar.doPixel(PixelSlice, int, int)}).
 * See {@link ExampleFilter3x3Scalar} and {@link ExampleFilter3x3Vector} for examples.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To <strong>apply</strong> as filter to a given image, the key method is 
 * {@link #applyTo(ImageProcessor)} (or {@link #applyTo(PixelPack)} if
 * the pixel data are already available as a {@link PixelPack}).
 * All filters operate destructively, i.e., by modifying the supplied image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link GenericFilter}s support asynchronous <strong>progress reporting</strong> based on the
 * {@link ProgressMonitor} framework. Here is a usage example (from one of the sample plugins):</p>
 * <pre>
 * ImageProcessor ip = ... // any image
 * ...
 * GenericFilter filter = new TschumperleDericheFilter();
 * try (ProgressMonitor m = new ProgressBarMonitor(filter)) {
 *     filter.applyTo(ip);
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * During execution of the filter, the {@link IjProgressBarMonitor} instance queries the filter
 * periodically (in a separate thread) for its progress status and updates ImageJ's progress
 * bar.
 * </p>
