/**
 * <p>
 * This (abstract) class represents a filter which treats all pixel values 
 * as scalars. If the processed image has more than one component 
 * (e.g., a RGB color image), this filter is automatically 
 * and independently applied to all (scalar-valued) components.
 * The filter calls the method {@code doPixel(PixelSlice, int, int)}
 * for each image pixel, which must be implemented by any concrete
 * sub-class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thus a custom filter based on this class only needs to specify the steps
 * to be performed for a single pixel. The remaining filter mechanics
 * including multiple components, out-of-bounds coordinate handling,
 * multiple passes and data copying are handled by this class and its super-class
 * (see {@link GenericFilter}).
