 * for each image pixel, which must be implemented by any concrete
 * sub-class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thus a custom filter based on this class only needs to specify the steps

 * including multiple components, out-of-bounds coordinate handling,
 * multiple passes and data copying are handled by this class and its super-class
 * (see {@link GenericFilter}).
